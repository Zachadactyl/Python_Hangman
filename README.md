# Python_Hangman
CS118 Group Project to build a hangman-based game in Python with full usability


Hangman-Main.py is the actual game we are building
Hangman_Dictionary.txt is the word bank
stats.txt is for recording wins/losses


test.py is my old code I'm using as a reference
functions_file.py is the file defining all the functions for test.py
